# cubified.github.io

My personal portfolio website, built with SvelteKit.

[Visit it here.](https://cubified.github.io)

## Testing and Building

Because SvelteKit is based on Vite, the build commands are as follows:

```
$ yarn dev
```

And:

```
$ yarn build
```

The latter will produce a static bundle of the website in `/build`.
